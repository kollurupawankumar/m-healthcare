Title : Distributed m-Healthcare Cloud Computing System
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The scope of our project a new technique of attribute-based designated verifier signature, a patient self controllable multi-level privacy-preserving cooperative authentication scheme realizing three levels of security and privacy requirement in distributed m-healthcare cloud computing system is proposed. By using model of key extraction algorithm which is used the directly authorized physicians, the indirectly authorized physicians and the unauthorized persons in medical consultation can respectively decipher the personal health information and/or verify patients’ identities by satisfying the access tree with their own attribute sets


Technologies used 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Java/J2EE , JSP etc
2. You need to dessign the DB of your own
3. Here we are storing in the normal system, it can replacced with cloud Amazon S3
4. Design templates are being taken from web templates from internet.
